# Mod_1.15.2
First Modding Experience in 1.15.2 for Minecraft
This project aims to just be a playground for learning how to mod minecraft (1.15.2) and learning the general way to do things.

A large portion of this is copied from a youtube video so it is not all my original creation.

The end goals of this project are to make a mimic pet that follows you, and is a chest, a block of quarters, a crocodile mob, and potentially a change to trying to sleep.
